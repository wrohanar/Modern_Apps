**Modern Apps Deployment with Kubernetes & CI/CD** 🚀
=====================================================

Welcome to the **Modern Apps** project! A cloud-native journey that takes your app from local development to the cloud, powered by Kubernetes, logging with Loki, monitoring with Grafana, and continuous integration with GitHub Actions.

* * * * *

**Project Overview** 🌍
-----------------------

This project demonstrates how to deploy an app using **Kubernetes**, set up automated **CI/CD pipelines** on **GitHub**, and implement powerful logging and monitoring tools like **Loki** and **Grafana**.

* * * * *

**What's Inside?** 🛠️
----------------------

-   **Kubernetes Cluster**: Run your app in the cloud with ease.
-   **Loki for Logging**: Keep track of your app's logs.
-   **Grafana for Monitoring**: Visualize logs and system metrics.
-   **GitHub Actions**: Automate your development pipeline---build, test, and deploy without lifting a finger.

**How We Built It** 🔨
----------------------

### 1\. **GitHub Repository Setup** 🔑

We kickstarted this project by creating a GitHub repository, ensuring our code is safe and synced across local and remote environments. Every change is tracked, making version control a breeze.

### 2\. **Kubernetes Setup** ⚙️

Using **Kubernetes**, we managed our app in the cloud. Kubernetes makes it easy to deploy and scale your app without worrying about the underlying infrastructure. We set up everything in a containerized environment, ready to handle thousands of requests.

### 3\. **Logging with Loki** 📝

To keep track of what's happening inside our app, we integrated **Loki**---a log aggregation system designed to handle logs from cloud-native applications. It collects logs from our app and stores them for easy access.

### 4\. **Grafana Dashboards** 📊

We didn't just stop at collecting logs. We used **Grafana** to turn those logs into beautiful, insightful dashboards. Now we can see what's happening in real-time, helping us catch issues and optimize our app.

### 5\. **CI/CD with GitHub Actions** 🚧

Every time you make a change, **GitHub Actions** runs automated processes to ensure everything is built, tested, and deployed smoothly. Push to GitHub, and watch your app deploy without any manual steps. We've set up the ultimate automation for developers!

**Getting Started** 🏁
----------------------

### 1\. **Clone the Repo** 🔄

Get the project onto your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wrohanar/Modern_Apps.git
cd Modern_Apps
```

### 2\. **Set Up Your Local Kubernetes Cluster** 🌱

Ensure you have a local Kubernetes environment running. You can use **Minikube** or **Docker Desktop** for local clusters.

### 3\. **Install Helm** 🛠️

Helm simplifies Kubernetes deployment. Make sure you have **Helm** installed to easily deploy apps to your cluster:

```bash
brew install helm
```

### 4\. **Deploy the App** 🚀

Deploy your app using Helm charts for **Loki**, **Promtail**, and **MyApp**.

### 5\. **Access Grafana** 📈

After the setup, port-forward the Grafana dashboard to your localhost:

```bash
kubectl port-forward service/loki-grafana 3000:80
```

Visit <http://localhost:3000> to explore the dashboards!
